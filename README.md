Artificial Intelligence: A Shadow of Human Intelligence
Course Objective
Artificial Intelligence tries to have machines do things that are normally associated with intelligence in humans. In the process, this also sheds light on the processes of human cognition.
This course will introduce these topics through lectures, class presentations and discussions, and most importantly, through projects. Each of you is also expected to select a project in which you will investigate some topic of current research interest, and you are expected to be able to communicate the key ideas of your project to others in the course.

Grading Scheme
Two Written Exams: 40%
Course Discussions, Homework and Labs: 10-15%
Final Project: 45-50%
Proposal: 5%
Presentation: 10%
Report: 15%
Demo/Oral: 20%
(approximately)
Projects
Projects from past years, assignments, solutions, and other details may be seen here.
Some projects with a Machine Learning focus which can be found here may also be relevant.
Owing to the high project weightage, project groups will be formed by lottery within the first two weeks of class.
Course Topics
For some topic, there will be additional presentations by students.
